DefiGatha Uganda will be a center for creating Web 3, Blockchain and crypto awareness, adoption, educational materials and other opportunities to the local communities of Uganda through hosting Blockchain and Near Events

There are many emerging blockchain Use cases, however most of them are very complex to be understood and used by local communities.

We have come up with strategies that will help to break the complicity through providing blckchain educational materials and courses, developing simpler use cases that can be used by any one in our country.

Our DefiGatha space will primarily be used as;

1. Workspace/dev hub to create our own dedicated tools
2. Event space for educational courses and Meetups
3. Internship opportunities for University students
4. Happy pay remittance, the house itself will have fait exchange-Crypto exchange
5. Offer Platform to other Blockchain communities to host their events and Hackathons
## GOALS
- Create a local  blockchain community of Devs in Uganda.
- Prepare our own local bockchain uses cases that can solve some problems in our country
- Spread Crypto and Near awareness to local communities through organizing Hackathons, Conferences, Seminars and  events.
- Create Internship and Job opportunities to University students
- Equip developers with Blockchan skills and experience in order to prepare their careers in Blockchain space 

## CHALLENGES
It is always a problem organizing and maintaining a Blockchain community without a specific place, however most of the times Social media is Used to keep in contact.
For development purposes an open space is needed where a group of Blockchain enthusiast can always meet to share ideas, and grow together as a team.

There are a lot of Myths about Crypto space due to lack of sensitization, complex Use cases, Low awareness and understanding of Blockchain terminologies among our community members.

For example some local members find it difficult using an exchange to convert Fait to crypto currency and vice versa, moreover, having an account on a centralized exchange requires KYC which can be against privacy and security, Recently,the Bank of Uganda announced regulations against Cryptocurriencies, it is now difficult to convert UGX to any Crypto using Bank payments or mobile Money payments, apart from P2P.

The current modes of payments including Mobile money payment systems all over the country have high transaction fees, including the tax which was recently added on by the government.

There are a lot of people deep in the villages who are still Un banked, even with the latest technology of mobile Banking, not everyone down in these villages has access to smart phones and Data
